# Group-Project
This code is for the mini-group project for **Lab 6** and **Lab 7**. The Python code repeatedly asks the user to type "YES" until the user types "YES".
## Authors
The first two authors on this code are Luke Kryka and Erza Cheifetz. We are both Freshman at the University of Pittsburgh and made this code for our Big Ideas in Computer science class. 
## Installation
Open a terminal in JupyterLab and type
`git clone https://github.com/LukeKryka/Group-Project.git`
## Usage
```Python
cont = True
while cont: 
#loop for inputing. End when boolean cont becomes false
    test = input("Type YES")
    #takes input from user and puts it in the variable "test"
    if test == "YES":
        cont = False
   	#checks if the user types "YES" and ends the loop if so
```
